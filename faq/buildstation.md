# BuildStation

**BuildStation** is our co-working and build-focused session series.  
It’s designed to give you uninterrupted time and the right environment to **ship your project**.

Here’s what you get at BuildStation:

- 💻 **Co-working Space** — Bring your laptop and grind alongside other builders.  
- 🧠 **Focused Sessions** — Work on bounties, side-projects, or hackathon submissions.  
- 🤝 **Collaboration** — Pair up with fellow developers, designers, or writers.  
- 🏆 **Support** — Mentors drop in to help unblock your progress.  

👉 BuildStation sessions are announced here: [Superteam Events](https://lu.ma/superteamIE)

Think of it as a **study group for Web3 builders**, but with a startup twist.

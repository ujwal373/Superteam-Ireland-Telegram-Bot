# Colosseum

The **Colosseum** is where builders pitch, battle, and shine.  
It’s our pitch + feedback arena designed to **test ideas in front of a live audience**.

What happens in the Colosseum?

- 🎤 **Live Pitches** — Builders present their ideas or early projects.  
- 🧑‍⚖️ **Feedback** — Judges, mentors, and peers give constructive insights.  
- 🏆 **Recognition** — The best ideas gain visibility and sometimes rewards.  
- 🤝 **Networking** — Investors, founders, and community members often tune in.  

👉 Keep an eye on [Superteam Earn](https://earn.superteam.fun/colosseum) for upcoming sessions.

It’s not about winning or losing — it’s about **refining your project, getting feedback, and connecting with supporters**.

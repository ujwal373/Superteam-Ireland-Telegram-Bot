# Superteam & Superteam Ireland — Basics

## What is Superteam (global)?
Superteam is the **talent layer of Solana**—a global community of founders, developers, designers, and operators who **learn, earn, and build** in crypto. Members collaborate on open projects, help teams ship, and grow the ecosystem.  
Useful context: Superteam runs **Superteam Earn**, a platform where companies post bounties/gigs and talent gets paid for results (design, dev, content, growth).

## What is Superteam Ireland?
**Superteam Ireland** is the Ireland chapter of the Superteam network. We support Irish builders through **meetups, co-working/build sprints, pitch sessions, and weekly talent touchpoints**, and connect people to paid opportunities via Superteam Earn.

## Our core programs (Ireland + global)
- **BuildStation** — Focused co-working to help you ship MVPs quickly; often aligned with the **Colosseum** Solana hackathon calendar. Expect mentors, work tables, lightning help, and a demo moment.  
- **Colosseum / Demo Days** — Pitch your prototype to mentors, partners, and the community. Great for pressure-testing ideas and finding collaborators.  
- **Meetups & AMAs** — Topic-led sessions (dev tooling, product, growth, design).  
- **Talent Hub (Fridays)** — Short weekly check-ins to share progress, unblock each other, and find teammates.  
- **Bounties / Grants** — Paid tasks, micro-grants, and project-based gigs surfaced through Superteam Earn.

## How to join (quick start)
1. Visit the **Superteam Ireland Hub** → details, links, and forms.  
2. Hop into the community **Telegram** & follow **X/Twitter** for announcements.  
3. Show up to **BuildStation / Talent Hub**, share what you’re building, and pick a **bounty** or small scope to start.  
4. Keep commits public and **demo often**—shipping beats slides.

## Opportunities via Superteam Earn
- **Bounties** (fast, scoped tasks)  
- **Projects/Gigs** (deeper, freelance)  
- **Grants** (ecosystem public-good work)  
Tip: Your completed bounties become a **portfolio** that helps you land gigs.

## Solana — quick primer for newcomers
- **Validators & Epochs**: Validators produce blocks; time is split into **epochs** (made of slots).  
- **Programs, Accounts, PDAs**: Smart contracts are “**programs**”. State lives in **accounts**. **PDAs** (program-derived addresses) are program-owned addresses derived from seeds.  
- **SPL Tokens**: Solana’s token standard; balances live in **token accounts**.  
- **Staking/Delegation**: Stake SOL to a validator via a **stake account** to earn rewards over epochs.  
- **RPC & Transactions**: Apps talk to **RPC** nodes to submit transactions and read chain state.

## Community norms
- Be respectful, constructive, and **credit collaborators**.  
- Share learnings openly; prefer demos over slides.  
- Ship → Iterate → Share → Repeat. ☘️
